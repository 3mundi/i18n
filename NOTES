# remove typify_localization_args?

I18n::Translation#typify_localization_args is a nice abstraction but it makes
it harder to document the different method signatures of #translate in the
classe where I18n::Translation is included. Maybe it would make sense to 
remove that method and instead implement #translate in those classes for 
clarity.

# treat Strings as keys, finally?

By now, this test passes:

I18n.backend.expects(:translate).with(:locale => Locale['en-US'], :keys => [:currency, :format, :precision])
:'currency.format.precision'.t @locale

This is pretty terse. But doesn't the symbol syntax look really weird somehow?
Maybe that's just because we don't see this kind of usage that often. But 
on the other hand this might be a reason to (finally) allow Strings-as-keys
side by side with Symbols-as-keys:

'currency.format.precision'.t @locale

I don't think we'll ever have default translations without explicit keys
again. So ...?
